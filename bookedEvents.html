<!--
  Shows the user a list of all the events the user has booked. This includes
  all upcoming events, as well as past events. The user can navigate to the event
  page by clicking a button on the event, or the event.

  Ideas: show all upcoming events first? grey out all past events (should still be able to see)?
  if the user clicks on event (or button on event) go to event page,
  so maybe show ticket book info? or not? idk? maybe order list based on date?
  or have filters? search bar?
