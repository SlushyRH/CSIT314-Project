on nearly every page, a header and footer can be seen.

the header allows the user to access the home page (index page),
and hte user can also access quick filters like categorys or 
upcoming (this limits the date between the current date, and 
one from now).

the header also shows the profile icon. upon clicking the profile
icon, it will direct the user to the login/signup page if they are
not currently logged in. if the user is logged in, then a dropdown
will show for easy navigation
